** Program Filename: Assignment 3
** Author: Megan Aldridge
** Date: February 14, 2016
** Description: This program allows a user to create two Barbarian, Vampire, Blue Men, Medusa
**		or Harry Potter (Creature objects) and subsequently enter those objects into a random
**		die roll based duel where they will lose attack, lose strength, and (if applicable)
**			use special powerups!
** Input: User will select from a menu to determine which Creatures will fight. User
**		will then choose whether to continue a fight, quit the fight, start a new battle,
**		or quit entirely.
** Output: The output displays each round of the fight including each creatures armor,
**		die roll, strength (before and after defending), and the result of the battle.
**		Menu functions also display choices to allow the user to determine if they want
**		to continue the battle, start a new one, or quit.
